It helps to understand how congestion happens and what are the technique and algorithms used in congestion control

#description
Main aim of this Mini Project is to illustrate the concepts and usage of Congestion 
Control in OpenGL. In data network and queuing theory, network congestion occurs when 
a link or node is carrying so much data that its quality of service deteriorates When more 
packets were sent than could be handled by intermediate routers, the intermediate routers 
discarded many packets, expecting the end points of the network to retransmit the 
information. When this packet loss occurred, the end points sent extra packets that 
repeated the information lost, doubling the data rate sent, exactly the opposite of what 
should be done during congestion. This pushed the entire network into a 'congestion 
collapse' where most packets were lost and the resultant throughput was negligible. We 
have used input devices like mouse and key board to interact with program
